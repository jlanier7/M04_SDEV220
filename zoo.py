 Program Purpose: 
  
1. Constants and variables:     
INITIALIZED:  
    - vehTypeAcceptable (tuple)     tuple with the acceptable value for vehType variable assignment input
    - doorsAcceptable   (tuple)     tuple with the acceptable values for doors variable assignment input
    - roofAcceptable    (tuple)     tuple with the acceptable values for roof variable assignment input
IN-LINE:
    - vehType           (string)    variable that holds input value for type of vehicle, to eventually pass to Car() as argument
    - year              (string)    variable that holds input value for year of vehicle, to eventually pass to Car() as argument
    - make              (string)    variable that holds input value for make of vehicle, to eventually pass to Car() as argument
    - model             (string)    variable that holds input value for model of vehicle, to eventually pass to Car() as argument    
    - doors             (string)    variable that holds input value for number of doors on the vehicle, to eventually pass to Car() as argument
    - roof              (string)    variable that holds input value for type of roof on vehicle, to eventually pass to Car() as argument
    - auto              (object)    object of class Car, created by variables gathering input in the while loop, that pass as attribute arguments at the end of the while 
                                    loop in the program
